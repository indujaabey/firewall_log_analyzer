**Analysis of logs and Proposed Mitigations**

The IP address 192.168.1.108, identified as an internal node within the network, has been observed attempting to access the SQL Server through SQL port 1433 on multiple occasions. Consequently, there have been multiple instances of access attempts on the SQL server. It is advisable to investigate the assets associated with this IP, analyze the specific activities attempted with both internal and outbound traffic originating from this asset. Despite being an internal IP, these actions cannot simply be disregarded because potential internal threats may exist for the organization.

IP 192.168.1.105</br>
•	The blocking of an action originating from a local IP to the broadcast address 192.168.1.255 is once again deemed suspicious, particularly due to the slightly elevated size in comparison to usual. The utilization of port 138 for NetBIOS services raises concerns. Since this is a broadcast address, it is unlikely to be associated with a printer (file and print sharing), suggesting the potential occurrence of irregular activity.</br>
•	The firewall log indicates the blocking of an unauthorized SSH attempt from the same IP. The destination is likely a public IP associated with an SSH server. It is advisable to implement brute force protection measures in response to such scenarios. Furthermore, the recurrent echo requests suggest a potential involvement in network diagnostic services. The device at 192.168.1.105 may be conducting checks to verify its connectivity with the DNS server.</br>

Firewall rules permit internal communication from IP 192.168.1.107 to 192.168.1.200 via port 445, commonly employed for Microsoft DS services, indicative of potential internal file sharing within the network. Port 445 is often associated with Server Message Block (SMB) functionality. To optimize internal communication policies, it is advisable to align them with the organization's specific requirements. In file sharing, employing best practices such as access controls, encryption, and regular security updates is crucial for maintaining robust security measures.</br>
The firewall has blocked communication from IP address 192.168.1.106 to 198.51.100.24 via port 80 (HTTP). Given that the traffic is unencrypted, it poses security concerns. It is recommended to enable HTTPS (port 443) traffic for a more secure connection. Furthermore, a careful examination of the device at 192.168.1.106 is necessary to understand the nature of the connection attempt, particularly because it attempted to connect using an unsecure protocol. Verification should be undertaken to determine whether this is a legitimate client seeking access to a web server.</br>
The permitted traffic from internal IP 192.168.1.109 to 192.168.1.210 suggests the potential establishment of an SSH connection for remote access to a local device. It is crucial to verify that this SSH connection aligns with company policies. Furthermore, it is recommended to enforce robust SSH authentication mechanisms to enhance the security of such remote connections.</br>
The log entry indicates that the device located at 192.168.1.110 attempted communication with 10.10.10.10 resulted in a "destination unreachable" status. It is advisable to investigate the network configuration on the device at 192.168.1.110 to confirm that routes and network settings are accurately configured. This investigation will help identify any potential issues causing the unreachable destination status.</br>
The firewall permits internal MySQL access from 192.168.1.111 to 192.168.1.220. In terms of security recommendations, it is essential to restrict MySQL access to only authorized clients. Additionally, enhance the security of MySQL communication by implementing encryption methods, and considering the use of SSL/TLS, as MySQL supports these protocols. This ensures a more secure and protected environment for MySQL transactions within the internal network.</br>
The logs indicate an SNMP access attempt from the IP address 192.168.1.112. It is imperative to identify the source device and assess the legitimacy of this activation. Additionally, a thorough examination of the SNMP configuration on the destination device (192.168.1.230) is recommended. It is crucial to ensure that SNMP is configured securely, incorporating proper authentication and access controls to enhance the overall security of the SNMP communication.</br>
As a comprehensive overall security recommendation, it is highly advisable to implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) not only for analyzing inbound traffic but also for analyzing internal traffic (Internal WAF). Connections made through ports 443 and 80 should be subject to WAF analysis, as this can effectively detect and mitigate application layer attacks such as XSS and SQL injections. Furthermore, to enhance security posture, the principle of least privilege should be enforced, ensuring that users and systems are granted only the minimum level of access necessary for their specific tasks. This approach helps minimize potential attack vectors and reinforces overall system security.
